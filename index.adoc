Welcome to the *Population Genomics Laboratory* of Department of Genetics, Genomics and Informatics at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. We are interested in understanding causes and consequences of genetic diversity and how natural selection in humans affects loci related to diseases.

=== Admixture Mapping and Pangenomics Analysis in the BIG Initiative Cohort

==== _Improving Phenotype-Genotype Linkages through Ancestry Patterns_

The Biorepository and Integrative Genomics (BIG) Initiative in Tennessee has developed a pioneering resource to address gaps in genomic research by linking genomic, phenotypic, and environmental data from a diverse Mid-South population, including underrepresented groups.   

image::images/website2025/BIG-notes-for-figures.png[BIG, 500,align=center,role='right']

BIG is recruiting participants from Memphis, TN, with plans to include a total of 100,000 samples over the next five years and it is partnering with the https://www.genomicinformationcommons.org/[Genomic Information Commons], a consortium of top children's hospitals, to conduct genomics research aimed at discovering the genetic foundations of human disease in diverse populations.

Analysis of 13,152 genomes from BIG revealed significant genetic diversity, with 50% of participants inferred to have non-European or various types of admixed ancestry, highlighting the importance of inclusive genomics in understanding health disparities.

.[maroon]#_Global ancestry deconvolution of 13,152 sequenced individuals, based on reference populations in the 1000 Genomes and HGDP data sets. Each vertical bar represents one individual, colors are proportional to inferred ancestry. For further analyses, individuals were grouped based on the ancestry proportions in seven categories (colored bar, number of individuals per category in parentheses), and classified as admixed or not (black and gray bar).

=== Human Pangenomics

A pangenome is a comprehensive collection of all the genetic variation present in a species, which overcomes the limitations of reference-based genomics by including both common and rare genetic variations in a single reference genome. 

The https://humanpangenome.org/[Human Pangenome Reference Project] aims to sequence 300 people to create a pangenome of 600 haplotypes and has currently released a first draft of the human pangenome reference based on 47 phased diploid assemblies from a group of genetically diverse individuals 

.[maroon]#_Well-known population stratification is not visible in the p-arms of acrocentric chromosomes. This observation is compatible with recombination occurring between the p-arms of heterologous acrocentric chromosomes. Here is an example of chromosome 15.  AFR: Africans; AMR: Native Americans; EAS: East-Asians; SAS: South-East Asians._#
image::images/pangenome_pca.png[pangenome_pca,600,align='center']

My team contributed to evaluate, for the first time, human population structure using markers from short arms of the acrocentric chromosomes [PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37165242/[37165242]]. We found that markers from these regions have less power to distinguish populations compared to other regions. This is consistent with the understanding that short arms of acrocentric chromosomes undergo recombination between non-homologous chromosomes, similar to the X and Y pseudohomologous regions [PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37165241/[37165241]]. Our findings on the patterns of linkage disequilibrium in these regions support this idea.

=== Mouse Pangenomics 

Mice members of BXDs family have been inbred for 20-200 generations. They are of great value for mapping complex traits and phenome-wide association analyses. Current genomic studies on BXD assume a single linear reference genome, making it difficult to observe sequences diverging from the reference, therefore limiting the accuracy and completeness of analyses. Pangenome models overcome this limitation as they contain the full genomic information of a species.

We are building a reference pangenome for all extant members of all BXD families leveraging third generation and 10X sequence data. We will analyze the genetic variation in relation to thousands of phenotypes in the https://genenetwork.org/ database.

=== Genomics of early embryonic development 

==== _How natural selection acts on early human development_

We investigate adverse outcomes of embryonic development like recurrent pregnancy loss and preeclampsia to identify the genetic factors that influence reproductive outcomes and pregnancy complications. This knowledge furthers our understanding of human evolution and informs efforts to improve pregnancy outcomes.

image::images/embryo.png[embryo,1000,500]


In *CABERNET* we aim to determine the extent of chromosomal mosaicism between embryonic and extraembryonic tissues using single cell DNA sequencing.
In *DELIVER / NEONATE* we want to identify genetic factors contributing to reproductive failure and recurrent miscarriage. We will use single cell strand sequencing to map balanced rearrangements and whole genome sequencing of euploid miscarried embryos to identify causative variants.
In *CANDLE* we want to uncover gene expression patterns associated with _APOL1_ risk alleles and preeclampsia in African American women. We will examine the role of ancestry in mediating the relationship between _APOL1_ genotype and preeclampsia risk. The results can provide insights into genetic and molecular basis of preeclampsia.

I am now leading the Population genomics laboratory at the University of Tennessee, College of Medicine, in the Department of Genetics, Genomics and Informatics._#

I am a genomicist and an expert in human evolutionary and population genomics and bioinformatics. In my postdoctoral research I was part of the international consortium 1000 Genomes[PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26432245/[26432245]; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23128226/[23128226]] where I led contributions to two specific aspects. First, I contributed to develop FunSeq [PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24092746/[24092746]], a tool that integrates non-coding information from relevant biological databases for the functional characterization of non-coding variants. Second, I lead a genome-wide scan to identify genomic regions with exceptionally high levels of population differentiation [PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24980144/[24980144]] demonstrating that these regions are enriched for positive selection events and that one half may be the result of classic selective sweeps. Findings from both sub-projects have since been applied to demographic inference and the molecular diagnosis of cancer and myeloid malignancies [PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27121471/[27121471], https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22446628/[22446628]], and to deeper studies on positive selection at the ABCA12 gene [PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30890716/[30890716]]. 

During my PhD I worked on human isolated populations contributing to characterize several isolated populations, describing the genomic consequences of isolation [PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17476112[17476112], https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19550436[19550436], https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22713810[22713810]], contributing to genetic association studies [PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16611673[16611673], https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18162505[18162505]] and to characterize rare variation [PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28643794[28643794]]
