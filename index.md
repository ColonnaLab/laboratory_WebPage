## Genomics of early embryonic development

<i> Hownatural selection acts on early human development</i>

We investigate adverse outcomes of embryonic development like recurrent pregnancy loss and preeclampsia to identify the genetic factors that influence reproductive outcomes and pregnancy complications. This knowledge furthers our understanding of human evolution and informs efforts to improve pregnancy outcomes.

<img src="images/embryo.png" alt="embryo" />

In <b>CABERNET</b> we aim to determine the extent of *chromosomal mosaicism between embryonic and extraembryonic tissues* using single cell DNA sequencing.
In <b>DELIVER / NEONATE</b> we want to identify genetic factors contributing to *reproductive failure and recurrent miscarriage*. We will use single cell strand sequencing to map balanced rearrangements and whole genome sequencing of euploid miscarried embryos to identify causative variants.
In <b>CANDLE</b> we want to uncover gene expression patterns associated with _APOL1_ risk alleles and preeclampsia in African American women. We will examine the role of ancestry in mediating the relationship between _APOL1_ genotype and preeclampsia risk. The results can provide insights into genetic and molecular basis of preeclampsia.

## Admixture Mapping and Pangenomics Analysis in the Biorepository and Integrative Genomics (BIG) Initiative Cohort

<i>Improving Phenotype-Genotype Linkages through Ancestry Patterns</i>

The BIG initiative is currently recruiting 30k participants from Memphis (TN), mostly children, with plans to include a total of 100,000 samples over the next five years. Nearly 45% of current participants are of African ancestry, and the cohort is partnering with the Genomic Information Commons, a consortium of top children's hospitals, to conduct genomics research aimed at discovering the genetic foundations of human disease in diverse populations. 

We want to understand the extent and origin of admixture patterns in the Biorepository and Integrative Genomics (BIG) Initiative cohort and to develop pipelines for admixture mapping of phenotypic traits related to diseases and natural selection phenotypes.


<img src="images/panmix.png" alt="panmix" width="30%"/>

We are using existing exome sequence data and electronic health records from 10k children to obtain an improved set of genetic variants, including structural variants through mapping against reference pangenomes and imputation. 

We will reconstruct the demographic history of the individuals in the cohort at individual and population levels, determine the identity of the ancestral populations and deconvolute their contribution to the genome of single individuals. The ancestry information will be used to identify patterns of natural selection and map phenotypic traits.

## Mouse Pangenomics 

Mice members of BXDs family have been inbred for 20-200 generations. They are of great value for mapping complex traits and phenome-wide association analyses. Current genomic studies on BXD assume a single linear reference genome, making it difficult to observe sequences diverging from the reference, therefore limiting the accuracy and completeness of analyses. Pangenome models overcome this limitation as they contain the full genomic information of a species.

We are building a reference pangenome for all extant members of all BXD families leveraging third generation and 10X sequence data. We will analyze the genetic variation in relation to thousands of phenotypes in the [GeneNetwork](https://genenetwork.org/) database.

|Vinc(Enza) Colonna | <img src="images/vcolonna.jpg" alt="Vc" width="40%"/> |I am a genomicist and an expert in human evolutionary and population genomics and bioinformatics.|
|---|---|---| 

*I graduated in Evolutionary Biology from the University of Naples Federico II and did postdoctoral research at the University of Ferrara (Italy) and at Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge (UK). I am now leading the Population genomics laboratory  at the IGB-CNR (Naples, Italy) and I am visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Tennessee, College of Medicine, in the Department of Genetics, Genomics and Informatics*

In my postdoctoral research I was part of the international consortium 1000 Genomes[PMID: 26432245; 23128226] where I led contributions to two specific aspects. First, I contributed to develop FunSeq [PMID: 24092746], a tool that integrates non-coding information from relevant biological databases for the functional characterization of non-coding variants. Second, I lead a genome-wide scan to identify genomic regions with exceptionally high levels of population differentiation [PMID: 24980144] demonstrating that these regions are enriched for positive selection events and that one half may be the result of classic selective sweeps. Findings from both sub-projects have since been applied to demographic inference and the molecular diagnosis of cancer and myeloid malignancies [PMID: 27121471, 22446628], and to deeper studies on positive selection at the ABCA12 gene [PMID: 30890716]. 

During my PhD I worked on human isolated populations contributing to characterize several isolated populations, describing the genomic consequences of isolation [PMID: 17476112, 19550436, 22713810], contributing to genetic association studies [PMID: 16611673, 18162505] and to characterize rare variation [PMID: 28643794]

I am working on the "Mouse Pangenomics Project". My research aims to construct the pangenome graph of model organisms, specifically inbred mice and rats, using a combination of short and long-read sequence data. This will enable genome-wide association studies to be performed directly on the pangenome. Additionally, I have a strong interest in understanding how mobile genetic elements have driven genome evolution through various mechanisms.
